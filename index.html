To rid her home of soldiers, Karuhimbi built up a reputation for being possessed by evil spirits. Her family were traditional healers from the village of Musamo, and Karuhimbi became a “healer”; she also was viewed by people as having “magical” powers. To further her witch looks, she painted herself with natural herbs that acted as an irritant. When Hutus came to her home, she claimed her house was filled with ghosts and those who tried to enter would “experience the wrath of god themselves”. Karuhimbi furthered this effect by jiggling the bracelets on her arms and stated that if any refugees were killed inside her house they would be “digging their own graves”.</p>

                Today, the world in rwanda is not as it seems. Women are suffering trauma from rapes, and many have HIV. Children are orphaned and abandoned. For now, the unemployment rates are rising. And yet we don’t care, the Hutus don’t care, and nobody seems to be doing anything. Even over 25 years later, the rwandan genocide has left a dent in the history of rwanda. Forever?
                <br>
                <br>
                Saving people from those armed with machetes and guns was no easy task. Especially when you’re a widow from a small town with little strength. That didn’t stop Zura Karuhimbi, though. She saved over 100 people from vicious Hutu soldiers, not relying on her strength but her mind. Karuhimbi built up a reputation for being possessed by evil spirits, and when the soldiers came to her home she claimed her house was filled with ghosts, and other threats. Zura, a hutu’s, story shows us hope even in times of trouble.
                <br>
                <br>
                Including when… During the rwandan genocide, the Hutu people were cruel enough to release people from hostpitals who where known to have HIV, and form them in to “rape squads”. These people were then told to rape Tutsi women, giving them a “slow, inevitable death”.
                <br>
                <br>
                Why be more cruel to the Tutsi woman you don’t know, that have family? Why not just end their suffering much faster with a machete, instead of relying on biological agents? As a human, how can we treat one another like this?
                <br>
                <br>
                The answer to these questions lies in dehumanization. Not only shown in the rwandan genocide, but also in the holocaust and in slave owners, dehumanization is treating, and more importantly, thinking, of someone as subhuman. When this happens, as shown historically, bad things happen. As jews in the holocaust were reffered to as rats, tutsis during the rwandan genocide were referred to as cockroaches. Being humans, we tend to notice subhuman things less in our psychological hierarchy of value.
                <br>
                <br>
                We should not treat humans subhuman, as hitler and hutu extremists did. We should not turn away when something troubling comes. We should not forget the many who are currently dying as a result of hiv. We should, as Zura has done, treat others equally, not as cockroaches. We should put others’ shoes on, but that first requires treating them as a human.
